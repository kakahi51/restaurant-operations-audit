# Restaurant Operations Audit

## Background
This project analyzes operational data from a small-scale food business to identify discrepancies in inventory usage, sales records, and cost structure.

## Problem Statement
Manual tracking caused inconsistencies between raw material input and recorded sales, leading to inaccurate stock records and unclear operational performance.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes anonymized records of inventory inputs, daily sales, and cost components.

## Analysis Approach
- Inventory reconciliation
- Discrepancy detection
- Profitability analysis

## Key Insights
1. Inventory discrepancies were consistently found between raw material usage and recorded sales, indicating potential over-portioning or unrecorded waste, which could directly reduce gross margin if left unaddressed.
2. Certain menu items showed high sales volume but low profitability due to inefficient cost allocation.
3. Daily reconciliation revealed recurring mismatches during peak hours, suggesting operational control weaknesses during high-demand periods.

## Recommendations
1. Implement daily inventory reconciliation to detect discrepancies early and reduce cumulative losses.
2. Standardize portion control for high-variance menu items to improve margin consistency.
3. Introduce basic operational dashboards to monitor inventory usage and sales alignment in real time.

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- SQL (joins, aggregation, reconciliation logic)
- Data modeling & schema design
- Operational analysis
- Business-oriented insights

This project demonstrates how structured data analysis can support operational control, improve inventory accuracy, and enable data-driven decision-making in small-scale businesses.
